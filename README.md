# Stressses in Composite Cylinders with Shrink Fits | Course Project, Dr. Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty, IIT Kharagpur

## Description
• Derived expressions for radial and circumferential stresses in the inner cylinder of a composite system using axisymmetric formulation.
• Determined the shrink fit allowance for equal strength using maximum shear stress theory.
